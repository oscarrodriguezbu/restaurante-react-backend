# DOCS:

## DESCRIPTION.
Backend build with nodeJs, express and MongoDB.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser.

## DEPLOY
This app has been deployed on railway.app for limited time or uses and I don't want to pay the Heroku plans. The link: [https://restaurante-react-backend-production.up.railway.app/](https://restaurante-react-backend-production.up.railway.app/)  


## ENV
I created a .env.template file to indicate what the .env file should have before uploading it to the GitHub repository, but since I needed to deploy it, I didn't put it in the .gitignore.
